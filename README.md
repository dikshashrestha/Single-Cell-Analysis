# Single Cell Analysis of Human Pancreas Reveals Transcriptional Singature of Aging and Somatic Mutation Patterns


The dataset is about ```Single Cell Analysis of Human Pancreas Reveals Transcriptional Signature of Aging and Somatic Mutation Patters``` where the dataset measures the effect of aging in human tissues by performing a single cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 pancreas cell from eight donors which are spanned in six decades of life. This dataset allows us to detect the feature of aging that are not coordinated across many cells that are affected in different cells. I have randomly set the seed as 120 so that my program would generate the same output everytime I run the program.
